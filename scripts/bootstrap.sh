# Placeholder bootstrap script
# TODO: Add commands you want to run on bootstrap (e.g., install packages, copy files from S3)
# Example:
# aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/bootstrap/config.conf /etc/myapp/
# sudo yum install -y htop

echo "Running placeholder bootstrap actions"

# Checklist (short):
# - [ ] Add commands to install dependencies or configure the node
# - [ ] Copy configuration or data from S3 if required
# - [ ] Ensure scripts are idempotent and safe to re-run
