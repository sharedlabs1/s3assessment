-- Placeholder SQL queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sample_table;
SELECT * FROM sample_table LIMIT 10;

-- TODO: Replace these examples with the queries required by your assessment.
-- Example: aggregation query for customer summary
-- SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
-- FROM transactions
-- GROUP BY customer_id
-- ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

-- Checklist (short):
-- - [ ] Add required query files requested by the README (e.g., customer_order_summary.sql)
-- - [ ] Ensure queries include comments indicating which task they satisfy
-- - [ ] Save queries under `queries/` as specified by the assessment
